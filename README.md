## Overview
The Rowdy Ball is a magic 8 ball app specifically designed for the students at University of Texas at San Antonio. The RowdyBall is an oracle in the shape of an 8 ball that the user will ask their yes or no questions to and the ball will predict the answer. The app is a digital version of the classic game that allows for the user to ask any and all questions they desire in a fun way so feel free to ask RowdyBall anything from the past to the future!
